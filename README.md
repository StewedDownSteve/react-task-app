# React Task Tracker App
A simple but effective task app. Was a great way to get comfortable with React.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Got to use React and really dive into components, props, state, hooks, and working with an API. It used React UI and JSON-server for a mock backend. I feel much more capable with React after making this app.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

I would like to honestly expand this and add a proper backend. Maybe expand the task to be able to hold more info like dates, a dashboard, and notifications. I would also like to add Google Auth to add security.

## Lessons Learned:

React! I hadn't gotten a lot of time to really play around with what it can do. I'm used to using CSS and other languages to make prototype apps so this was a lot of fun.
